</div>

### Description

######## SOURCE w/Example #########

This is the easy Scrolling Credits, i have ever seen.. all you do is include the OCX then drag it on form....you can customize it too you needs. Like 3d or not, bordercolor, backcolor, forecolor, and more..... Hope you like it By the way i made this code cause i was sick and tired of programing credits each time i wanted to make a program... this is 100% easier
 
### More Info
 
text input, credits1.text

USAGE

credits1.text = "What you want to say" & _

vbnewline & "Something else to say on next line"

Feel free to use this in any program, comercial or non-comercial
